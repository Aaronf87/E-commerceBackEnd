A walkthrough video shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia.


This application was developed with
### nodejs
### [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
### insomina
### express 
### [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) 
### [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)






The [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.


After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
